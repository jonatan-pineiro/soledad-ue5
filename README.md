# 🌊 SOLEDAD — Narrative Unreal Engine 5 Project

**SOLEDAD** is a narrative-driven experience developed in **Unreal Engine 5**, focused on emotional gameplay, atmosphere, and player introspection.

The project takes place on a beach at dawn.  
The player advances through space, silence, and interaction rather than traditional mechanics, aiming to create a sense of connection, accompaniment, and emotional reflection.

This project is designed as a **portfolio piece** to explore gameplay systems, narrative design, and technical implementation in Unreal Engine.
